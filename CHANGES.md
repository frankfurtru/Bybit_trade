# Bybit Zai Bot - Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the Bybit Zai Bot and make it work with public endpoints only.

## Key Changes

1. **Added `public_only` Mode**
   - Modified `BybitConfig` class to include a `public_only` flag
   - Added configuration option in `config.py` with `BYBIT_PUBLIC_ONLY` environment variable
   - Default value is `True`, making the bot use only public endpoints by default

2. **Authentication Toggle**
   - Added `bot_auth_required` option to `Config` class
   - Added `BOT_AUTH_REQUIRED` environment variable (default: false)
   - Modified authentication checks to respect this setting

3. **MCP Server Updates**
   - Split tools into public and private categories
   - Only expose private tools when `public_only` is `False`
   - Updated error messages when private tools are called in public_only mode

4. **Client Improvements**
   - Added `can_access_private_endpoints()` method to check if private endpoints can be called
   - Updated client initialization to work without API keys when in public_only mode

## How to Use

1. **Public Only Mode (Default)**
   - Bot will only use public endpoints like price checking, market data, etc.
   - No authentication required
   - Simply ask questions like "what's the current BTC price?" and the bot will use the public API

2. **Full Mode**
   - Set `BYBIT_PUBLIC_ONLY=false` in your .env file
   - Provide valid `BYBIT_API_KEY` and `BYBIT_API_SECRET`
   - Optionally enable authentication with `BOT_AUTH_REQUIRED=true`

## Testing

Testing has been unified into a single script `test_natural_language.py` to keep the repo tidy.

Run it with:
```
python test_natural_language.py
```
It includes:
- Public API sanity checks (server time, ticker, kline, orderbook)
- Natural language queries (price, compare, arbitrage, overview)

## Remaining Issues

If you encounter any issues, please check:
1. Make sure your LLM API key is valid
2. Check that the Bybit API is responding properly
3. Verify network connectivity to the Bybit API servers

## Latest Updates (Performance & Unification)

- General chat (non-trading) replies are now much faster:
  - Added heuristic to route small-talk directly to LLM (single call)
  - Router LLM runs in background thread and uses max_tokens=256
  - Router can return a direct `reply` to avoid a second call
  - Added Telegram error handler to reduce crashes on timeouts
- Unified entrypoint: `src/main.py` now contains the enhanced bot. Removed duplicates: `src/enhanced_main.py`, `src/main_complete.py`.
- Unified tests: merged `test_public_api.py` and `test_market_overview.py` into `test_natural_language.py`.
- Private endpoints now gated strictly in public-only mode with clearer guidance.
